"Explore Charlotte neighborhoods while doing the things you love." INTown unlocks the discovery of events, outdoor spaces, popular places, and restaurants in each selected neighborhood. This App has several components, creating a user interactivity that is tailored to the indivdual. 

On the landing page, the search box allows the user to select a neighborhood. Once the neighborhood is selected, a description of the selected neighborhood is displayed. On the click of the search button, the user it navigated to the results page.

The results page displays a Google map of the selected neighborhood and the user is given the option to narrow their search to four different criteria; events, outdoor spaces, popular places, and restaurants. When the user selects which search criteria they want to look for, each item is pinpointed on the map using the criteria's specific icon. Each criteria selected is also displayed within its given card below the map, showing listed options for the user. 

The the listed items in each card is data pulled from either the Google maps API (outdoor spaces, popular, and restaurants) or the Ticketmaster API(events) displaying content for the user.
